    <h1>Gramma's Old Fashioned Chili Mac</h1>
    <img>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an old family recipe that my mom has cooked for 50 years. It's a wonderful, 'stick-to-the-ribs' meal that goes wonderful with warm cornbread or rolls. I find that kids love this when they don't like regular 'spicy' chili. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Â½ large green bell pepper, chopped</li>

        <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained</li>
        <li>2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup</li>
    </ul>
