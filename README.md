# odin-recipes

This project is the first one in The Odin Project Foundations course.
It's good to see a website that off-the-bat is forcing you to work in Development environments.

The plan here is to build a Website with a few different elements, but purely HTML. No CSS. That and managing file and folder structure (which in my case still has some room for improvement).
